# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (referred to here as "the Site" or "we")! 👋 Before you dive in and use our services, please take a moment to carefully read these Terms of Service. By accessing or using the Site, you're signaling your agreement and acceptance of these terms.

## 1. About Our Services
The Site offers users a variety of paid subscription content and membership services. This includes, but isn't limited to, blog posts, exclusive resources, e-books, and community interaction. Just a heads-up, some content is only accessible to our awesome subscribers.

## 2. User Registration & Accounts
*   Users need to provide a valid email address and set up a password to register for an account. Easy peasy!
*   Users are totally responsible for the security of their account and all activities under it. Seriously, **no transferring or sharing** your account with anyone else.
*   The Site reserves the right to **suspend or terminate** any account if a user violates these terms. Fair warning!

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
*   Subscription services are billed on a monthly/annual basis. Don't worry, the fees will be clearly displayed on the checkout page.
*   All payments are processed securely through third-party payment platforms (like Stripe, PayPal). The Site doesn't store any of your payment info – your privacy is a top priority!
*   Subscriptions will **auto-renew**, so keep that in mind! Make sure to cancel before the end of your current billing cycle if you don't want it to continue.
*   Our **14-day Refund Policy** is pretty straightforward: If you're a first-time subscriber and not totally happy with our service, you can request a full refund within 14 days of purchase. Just hit us up via the contact email provided at the end of these terms and tell us why you're seeking a refund. Heads up: Each user gets one refund shot! After 14 days, or for non-first-time subscriptions, **no refunds** will be issued unless mandated by law.

## 4. Content Usage & Intellectual Property
*   All original content is **copyrighted by the Site (hubtoday)**. Please don't copy, reproduce, or use it for commercial purposes without our express permission!
*   Users only get **non-exclusive, non-transferable access** for personal learning and reading. It's all about that personal growth!
*   For commercial use or extensive quoting, please reach out to the Site to get proper authorization. Let's keep things legit!

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
*   Users are **strictly prohibited** from uploading, posting, or distributing any content that's illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or infringes on others' rights. Play nice!
*   It's also **forbidden** to mass download, crawl, or crack member-only content using technical means. No shady stuff!
*   The Site reserves the right to remove inappropriate content and **ban violating users**. We mean business!

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions
*   We reserve the right to change, suspend, or terminate any part or all of our services at any time, without prior notice. Just a heads-up!
*   The Site **won't be liable for compensation** if content is temporarily unavailable due to force majeure, server failures, or third-party service interruptions. Sometimes things just happen beyond our control!

## 7. Disclaimer
*   The information provided by the Site is for reference only and **doesn't constitute** any professional advice (like financial, legal, or medical). We're here to inform, not advise!
*   The Site **won't be responsible** for any direct or indirect losses users might incur from using our content or services. Use your best judgment!

## 8. Governing Law
*   These Terms of Service are governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of California, USA, without regard to its conflict of law principles. Standard legal stuff!
*   For any disputes arising from or related to these terms, both parties agree to first try and resolve them through friendly negotiation. If that doesn't work out, you agree to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts located in Santa Clara County, California. Let's hope it doesn't come to that!
