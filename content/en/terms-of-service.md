# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (aka "The Site" or "We")! 👋 Before you dive in and use our services, please take a moment to carefully read these Terms of Service. By visiting or using **ai.hubtoday**, you're essentially saying "I agree!" to these terms.

## 1. Service Introduction
Our **Services** offer users a sweet deal of paid subscription content and exclusive membership perks. Think blog posts, special resources, ebooks, community interactions, and more! Just a heads-up: some content is strictly for our subscribed members only. 😉

## 2. User Registration & Accounts
- **To register an account**, users need to provide a valid email address and set up a password.
- **Your account's security** is totally on you, and you're responsible for all activities happening under it. Seriously, **NO** transferring or sharing your account – that's a big no-no! 🙅‍♀️
- **We** reserve the right to **suspend or terminate** your account if you ever breach these terms. Just sayin'.

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
- **Our subscription service** bills monthly/annually, with all charges clearly laid out on the checkout page.
- **All payments** go through trusted third-party platforms (like Stripe, PayPal) – don't worry, we never store your payment info. We've got your back! ✅
- **Your subscription** will **automatically renew** unless you cancel it before your current billing cycle ends. Easy peasy.
- **Our 14-day refund policy** is pretty sweet: if you're a first-time subscriber and not totally stoked with our service, you can request a full refund within 14 days of purchase. Just hit us up at the contact email provided at the end of these terms, and let us know why you're not happy. Heads-up: each user gets one refund shot. After 14 days, or if it's not your first rodeo, **no refunds** will be issued after payment, unless the law absolutely forces our hand. So choose wisely! 💸

## 4. Content Usage & Intellectual Property
- **All original content** here is **copyrighted by us (hubtoday)**. That means you absolutely cannot copy, reproduce, or use it for commercial purposes without our express permission. Nuh-uh! 🚫
- **Users** get a **non-exclusive, non-transferable access right** for personal learning and reading only. Think of it as your personal library pass! 📚
- **For any commercial use** or if you want to quote a lot of our stuff, please reach out to us to get authorization. We're usually pretty friendly! 😉

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
- **Users are strictly forbidden** from uploading, posting, or spreading any content that is illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or infringes on others' rights. Play nice, folks! 🙏
- **Also, it's a huge NO-GO** to bulk download, scrape, or hack our member content using technical means. Seriously, don't even try it. 🛑
- **We** have the right to remove inappropriate content and **ban rule-breaking users**. Consider this your fair warning! 🚨

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions
- **We** reserve the right to change, suspend, or terminate any part or all of our services at any time, without prior notice. Just a heads up, things can change! 🔄
- **If our content becomes temporarily unavailable** due to unforeseen circumstances, server glitches, or third-party service interruptions (think "acts of God" or tech hiccups), **we won't be liable for compensation**. Bummer, we know. 🤷‍♀️

## 7. Disclaimer
- **The information provided on this site** is purely for reference. It's definitely **NOT** professional advice (like financial, legal, medical, etc.). Always consult a pro for that stuff! 💡
- **We** are absolutely **NOT responsible** for any direct or indirect losses users might incur from using our content or services. Use at your own risk! 🚫

## 8. Governing Law
- **These Terms of Service** are governed by and interpreted under the laws of the State of California, USA, without regard to its conflict of law principles. Keeping it official! ⚖️
- **For any dispute** arising from or related to these terms, both parties agree to first try and resolve it through friendly negotiation. If that doesn't work out, you agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in Santa Clara County, California. Let's hope it doesn't come to that! 🙏
