# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (referred to as “**the Site**” or “**we**”)! Before you jump into using our services, please take a moment to carefully read these Terms of Service. By accessing or using the Site, you're agreeing to and accepting these terms.

## 1. Services Overview

The Site offers users a bunch of cool paid subscription content and membership services! This includes, but isn't limited to, blog articles, exclusive resources, e-books, and lively community interactions. Just a heads-up: some content is exclusively for our subscribed members.

## 2. User Registration & Accounts

- To register for an account, you'll need to provide a valid email address and set up a password. Simple!
- You're totally responsible for your account's security and all activities happening under it. Seriously, **no transferring or sharing** your account – that's a big no-no!
- If you break these terms, the Site reserves the right to **suspend or terminate** your account. Just sayin'.

## 3. Paid Subscription Services

- Our subscription services are billed on a monthly or annual basis, and the exact fees are clearly laid out on the checkout page. No hidden surprises!
- All payments zoom through secure third-party platforms (like Stripe, PayPal). Rest assured, the Site never stores your payment information. Phew!
- Your subscription will **automatically renew**, so keep that in mind! If you want to cancel, just make sure to do it before your current billing cycle ends.
- **14-Day Refund Policy**: Hey, we get it! If you're a first-time subscriber and not totally thrilled with our service, you can request a full refund within 14 days of purchase. Just hit us up via the contact email at the end of these terms and tell us why you're leaving. Each user gets one shot at this refund. After 14 days, or if it's not your first subscription, all payments are **non-refundable**, unless the law absolutely forces our hand.

## 4. Content Use & Intellectual Property

- Listen up! All original content here is **copyrighted by the Site (hubtoday)**. That means no copying, reprinting, or using it for commercial purposes without our permission. Seriously, don't do it! 🙅‍♀️
- You, as a user, only get a **non-exclusive, non-transferable right** to access this content for your personal learning and reading. It's just for you, got it?
- If you're dreaming of using our stuff for commercial purposes or need to quote extensively, please reach out to the Site to get proper authorization. Let's chat!

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines

- We have a strict "no-go" policy here: It's **absolutely forbidden** to upload, post, or spread any content that's illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or infringes on anyone else's rights. Play nice! 🚫
- Also, seriously **don't try to mass download**, scrape, or crack our member content using any technical trickery. We see you! 👀
- The Site reserves the right to remove any inappropriate content and will **ban users who violate** these rules. Fair warning!

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions

- Just so you know, we reserve the right to change, suspend, or even terminate parts or all of our services at any time, and sometimes without giving you a heads-up. It's just how the tech world rolls! 🚀
- If, for some wild reason like an act of God, a server meltdown, or a third-party service hiccup, our content becomes temporarily unavailable, the Site **cannot be held responsible for compensation**. Bummer, we know.

## 7. Disclaimer

- Heads-up! The info provided on this Site is purely for reference and **doesn't count** as any kind of professional advice (like financial, legal, medical, you name it!). Always consult a pro for that stuff. 🧠
- For any direct or indirect losses you might bump into from using our content or services, the Site **cannot be held responsible**. Just wanted to make that super clear.

## 8. Governing Law

- So, these Terms of Service are basically run by and interpreted under the laws of California, USA 🇺🇸, and we're not bringing any pesky conflict-of-law principles into the mix.
- If any beef arises from or relates to these terms (hopefully not!), we promise to try and hash things out amicably first. But if we can't quite see eye-to-eye, you agree to take it to the courts in Santa Clara County, California. Let's keep it civil, folks!
