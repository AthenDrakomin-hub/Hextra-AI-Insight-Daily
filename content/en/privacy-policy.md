*Last updated: June 1, 2025*

---

This Privacy Policy outlines our policies and procedures for collecting, using, and disclosing your information when you use our Service. It also informs you about your privacy rights and how the law keeps you safe. 🛡️

We use your personal data to provide and improve our Service. By using the Service, you agree to our collection and use of information in line with this Privacy Policy. Sweet! ✨

## Explanations & Definitions

### Explanations
Capitalized words have meanings defined under the conditions below. These definitions hold true whether they pop up in singular or plural form – they mean the same thing, no fuss!

### Definitions
For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, here's the lowdown: 👇

- **Account** means a unique account we whip up for you to get into our Service, or specific bits of it. Think of it as your personal key! 🔑

- **Affiliate** means an entity that's got control over a party, is controlled by a party, or is chilling under common control with a party. When we say "control," we're talking about owning 50% or more of the shares, equity, or other voting securities needed to elect directors or other big-shot managers.

- **Company** (which you'll also see as "We," "Us," or "Our" in this Agreement) means **hubtoday**. That's us! 👋

- **Cookies** are just tiny files a website pops onto your computer, phone, or any other gadget. They store little bits of info, like your browsing history on that site, for all sorts of uses. 🍪

- **Country**? That's California, USA! 🇺🇸

- **Device** is any gadget that can hook up to our Service – think computers, phones, or even your trusty digital tablet. 💻📱

- **Personal Data** is any info that's tied to an identified or identifiable person. Pretty straightforward, right?

- **Service** is basically this very Website you're using. Ta-da! ✨

- **Service Provider** is any natural or legal person (like an individual or another company) who crunches data for the Company. We're talking about third-party companies or folks we've hired to help run the Service, deliver it for us, handle Service-related tasks, or help us figure out how the Service is being used. They're like our helpful sidekicks! 🦸

- **Usage Data** is automatically collected data, basically generated by you using the Service or from the Service's own infrastructure. Think of it as data showing how you interact with us – like how long you hang out on a certain page. ⏱️

- **Website**? That's **hubtoday**, and you can find it right here: `https://ai.hubtoday.app/`. Bookmark it! 📌

- **You** means... well, *you*! The individual chilling on or using our Service. Or, if you're rocking it on behalf of a company or other legal entity, then it means that entity. Got it? 👍

## Collecting & Using Your Personal Data

### Types of Data We Collect

#### Personal Data
When you're using our Service, we might ask you to hand over some personally identifiable information that we can use to contact or identify you. This "Personal Data" might include, but isn't limited to: 📝

- Email address
- Usage data

#### Usage Data
Usage Data is automatically collected when you're rocking our Service. No extra clicks needed! 🚀

Usage Data might include your device's Internet Protocol address (AKA IP address), what type of browser you're using, its version, which pages on our Service you hit up, the time and date of your visit, how long you hung out on those pages, unique device identifiers, and other diagnostic data. It's all about understanding how things work!

When you access the Service using a mobile device, we might automatically snag certain info. This includes, but isn't limited to, the type of mobile device you're using, its unique ID, your mobile device's IP address, your mobile operating system, the type of mobile internet browser you're rocking, unique device identifiers, and other diagnostic data. Mobile usage gets its own special stats! 📱📊

We might also collect information your browser sends our way when you visit our Service or access it from a mobile device. Your browser's got secrets, and sometimes it shares! 🤫

### Tracking Technologies & Cookies
We totally use Cookies and similar tracking technologies to keep an eye on activity on our Service and stash away some info. These tracking tech goodies include beacons, tags, and scripts, all designed to collect and track info, and help us level up and analyze our Service. The tech we might use includes: 👇

- **Cookies or Browser Cookies**: A Cookie is just a tiny file that gets placed on your Device. You can totally tell your browser to refuse all Cookies or to give you a heads-up when one's being sent. But, heads up! If you don't accept Cookies, some parts of our Service might not play nice. Unless you've tweaked your browser settings to reject Cookies, our Service might just use 'em anyway. 🤷‍♀️
- **Web Beacons**: Certain parts of our Service and our emails might contain small electronic files known as web beacons (AKA clear GIFs, pixel tags, and single-pixel GIFs). These nifty files let the Company (for example) count users who've visited those pages or opened an email, and for other cool website stats (like checking out a section's popularity and verifying system and server integrity). They're like tiny spies! 🕵️‍♀️

Cookies can be either "Persistent" or "Session" Cookies. Persistent Cookies hang around on your personal computer or mobile device even when you're offline, while Session Cookies vanish into thin air as soon as you close your web browser. Poof! 💨

We use both Session and Persistent Cookies for the following reasons: 👇

- **Necessary / Essential Cookies**
  - **Type**: Session Cookies
  - **Managed by**: Us
  - **Purpose**: These Cookies are absolutely vital to give you the services available through the Website and to let you use some of its cool features. They help authenticate users and prevent fraudulent use of user accounts. Without these Cookies, the services you've asked for can't be provided, and we only use these Cookies to deliver those services to you. Gotta have 'em! 💪

- **Cookies Policy / Acceptance Cookies**
  - **Type**: Persistent Cookies
  - **Managed by**: Us
  - **Purpose**: These Cookies are all about figuring out if users have given the green light to the use of Cookies on the Website. It's like a digital handshake! 🤝

- **Functionality Cookies**
  - **Type**: Persistent Cookies
  - **Managed by**: Us
  - **Purpose**: These Cookies are super helpful because they let us remember choices you make when you use the Website – like keeping your login deets or language preferences in mind. The goal here is to give you a more personalized experience, so you don't have to re-enter your preferences every single time you visit. So convenient! 😊

### Retention of Your Personal Data
The Company will only hold onto your Personal Data for as long as it's necessary for the purposes laid out in this Privacy Policy. We'll keep and use your Personal Data to meet our legal obligations (like if we need to hold onto your data to follow applicable laws), resolve disputes, and enforce our legal agreements and policies. We're all about playing by the rules! 📜

The Company will also keep Usage Data for internal analysis purposes. Typically, Usage Data is held for a shorter period, unless that data is used to beef up the security of our Service or to improve its functionality, or if we're legally obligated to hold onto this data for longer. Security first! 🔒

### Transfer of Your Personal Data
Your information (yeah, including your Personal Data!) gets processed at the Company's operating offices and wherever else the parties involved in the processing are located. This means your info might get shipped over to and stored on computers outside of your state, province, country, or other government jurisdiction, where the data protection laws might be different from yours. It's a global operation! 🌍

By agreeing to this Privacy Policy and handing over your info, you're giving a big thumbs up to that transfer. So, you're cool with it! 👍

The Company will go all out to take every reasonably necessary step to make sure your data is handled securely and in line with this Privacy Policy. We won't transfer your Personal Data to any organization or country unless there are super solid controls in place, including top-notch security for your data and other personal info. Your data's safety is our priority! 🔒✨

### Deleting Your Personal Data
You've got the right to delete, or ask us to help you delete, the Personal Data we've collected about you. It's your info, after all! 💪

Our Service might even let you delete certain info about yourself right from within the Service. How convenient is that?

You can totally update, change, or delete your info anytime by logging into your account (if you have one, of course!) and hitting up the account settings section where you can manage your personal info. You can also just give us a shout to request access to, correct, or delete any personal info you've given us. We're here to help you manage your digital footprint! 👣

Just a heads-up though, we might need to hang onto some info when we've got a legal obligation or a legit reason to do so. Some things just have to stick around! 🤷‍♀️

### Disclosure of Your Personal Data

#### Business Transactions
If the Company gets caught up in a merger, an acquisition, or an asset sale, your Personal Data might get transferred. We'll definitely give you a heads-up before your Personal Data is moved and becomes subject to a different Privacy Policy. Forewarning is caring! 📣

#### Law enforcement
Sometimes, the Company might have to spill your Personal Data if the law demands it, or if we get a valid request from public authorities (like a court or a government agency). We gotta follow the rules! 🚔

#### Other Legal Requirements
The Company might also dish out your Personal Data if we genuinely believe it's necessary to: 👇
- Comply with a legal obligation
- Protect and defend the rights or property of the Company
- Prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the Service
- Protect the personal safety of Users of the Service or the public
- Protect against legal liability

### Security of Your Personal Data
The security of your Personal Data is a big deal to us! But hey, remember, no method of transmission over the Internet, or electronic storage, is ever 100% bulletproof. While we hustle to use commercially acceptable ways to protect your Personal Data, we can't guarantee its absolute security. We're doing our best! 🤞

## Children's Privacy
Our Service isn't for anyone under the age of 13. Seriously, kids, this isn't your playground! We don't knowingly scoop up personally identifiable info from anyone under 13. If you're a parent or guardian and you know your kiddo has given us Personal Data, please hit us up. If we find out we've collected Personal Data from anyone under 13 without verifiable parental consent, we'll take steps to delete that info from our servers ASAP. Kids' privacy is no joke! 👶🛑

If we need to lean on consent as a legal basis to process your info, and your country requires parental consent, we might ask for your parent's permission before we collect and use that info. Parental supervision for the win! 👨‍👩‍👧

## Links to Other Websites
Our Service might have links to other websites that we don't actually operate. If you click on a third-party link, boom! You'll be whisked away to that third party's site. We seriously recommend you check out the Privacy Policy of every single site you visit. Stay safe out there! 🔗🕵️‍♀️

We've got zero control over, and take zero responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services. Just keeping it real! 🚫

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
We might update our Privacy Policy every now and then. We'll let you know about any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy right here on this page. So keep an eye out! 👀

Before the changes actually kick in, we'll give you a heads-up via email and/or a noticeable announcement on our Service. We'll also update that "Last updated" date right at the top of this Privacy Policy. Transparency is key! 🔑

We totally recommend you peek at this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy become effective the moment they're posted on this page. So, stay in the loop! 🔄
