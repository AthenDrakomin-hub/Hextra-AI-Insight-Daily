-   Email address
-   Usage Data

#### Usage Data
Usage Data? It's automatically scooped up when you use the Service.

This Usage Data might include your device's Internet Protocol address (like your IP address), browser type, browser version, the pages of our Service you visit, the time and date of your visit, how long you chill on those pages, unique device identifiers, and other diagnostic data.

### Tracking Technologies and Cookies
We use Cookies and similar tracking tech to keep tabs on activity on our Service and store certain info. The tracking tech we roll with includes beacons, tags, and scripts, all used to collect and track info, and to fine-tune and analyze our Service. The tech we use might include:

-   **Cookies or Browser Cookies**: A Cookie is a small file dropped onto your Device. You can tell your browser to straight-up refuse all Cookies or to give you a heads-up when one's being sent. But hey, if you don't accept Cookies, some parts of our Service might not play nice. Unless you've tweaked your browser settings to reject 'em, our Service might just use Cookies.
-   **Web Beacons**: Certain sections of our Service and our emails might contain tiny electronic files called web beacons (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags, and single-pixel gifs). These bad boys let the Company, for example, count users who've visited those pages or opened an email. They're also used for other related website stats (like checking out how popular a certain section is and verifying system and server integrity).

Cookies can be "Persistent" or "Session" Cookies. Persistent Cookies chill on your personal computer or mobile device even after you go offline, while Session Cookies vanish the moment you close your web browser.

We use both Session and Persistent Cookies for the following reasons:

-   **Necessary / Essential Cookies**
    -   **Type**: Session Cookies
    -   **Administered by**: Us
    -   **Purpose**: These Cookies are absolutely crucial to give you the services available through the Website and to let you use some of its cool features. They help authenticate users and prevent fraudulent use of user accounts. Without these Cookies, the services you've asked for can't be delivered, and we only use these Cookies to provide you with those services.

-   **Cookies Policy / Notice Acceptance Cookies**
    -   **Type**: Persistent Cookies
    -   **Administered by**: Us
    -   **Purpose**: These Cookies are all about figuring out if users have accepted the use of cookies on the Website.

    -   **Administered by**: Us
    -   **Purpose**: These Cookies help us remember the choices you make when you're using the Website – like remembering your login deets or language preferences. The whole point of these Cookies is to give you a more personalized experience and save you the hassle of re-entering your preferences every single time you use the Website.

For even more deets on the Cookies we use and your options regarding them, just swing by our Cookies Policy or the Cookies section of our Privacy Policy.

### How Your Personal Data Gets Used
The Company might use Personal Data for a bunch of reasons, like:

-   **To provide and maintain our Service**, which includes keeping an eye on Service usage.
-   **To manage Your Account**: This means handling your registration as a Service user. The Personal Data you hand over gives you access to the different features available to registered users.
-   **For the performance of a contract**: To nail down, follow through, and execute the purchase contract for the products, items, or services you've bought, or any other contract you've got with us through the Service.
-   **To contact You**: We'll reach out via email, phone calls, SMS, or other similar electronic communication forms (like push notifications from a mobile app) to clue you in on updates or informational communications related to features, products, or contracted services, including security updates, whenever they're necessary or make sense.
-   **To provide You with news**, special offers, and general info about other goods, services, and events we're offering that are similar to what you've already bought or asked about, unless you've opted out of getting such info.
-   **To manage Your requests**: To handle and sort out the requests you send our way.
-   **For business transfers**: We might use your info to suss out or pull off a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, or other sale or transfer of some or all of our assets. This could be as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar proceedings, where Personal Data held by us about our Service users is one of the assets being transferred.
-   **For other purposes**: We might use your info for other stuff, like data analysis, spotting usage trends, figuring out how effective our promotional campaigns are, and to evaluate and improve our Service, products, marketing, and your overall experience.

We might share your personal info in these situations:

-   **With Service Providers**: We might hand over your personal info to Service Providers to keep an eye on and analyze our Service's usage, and to get in touch with you.
-   **For business transfers**: We might share or transfer your personal info during or in negotiations of any merger, sale of Company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company.
-   **With Affiliates**: We might share your info with our Affiliates, and in those cases, we'll demand that those Affiliates play by this Privacy Policy. Affiliates include our parent company and any other subsidiaries, joint venture partners, or other companies that we control or that are under common control with us.
-   **With business partners**: We might share your info with our business partners to hook you up with certain products, services, or promotions.
-   **With other users**: When you swap personal info or interact in public areas with other users, that info might be seen by all users and could even be made public outside the Service.
-   **With Your consent**: With your green light, we might spill your personal info for any other reason.

### Keeping Your Personal Data Around
The Company will only hang onto your Personal Data for as long as it's needed for the purposes laid out in this Privacy Policy. We'll keep and use your Personal Data to the extent necessary to follow our legal obligations (like if we need to keep your data to comply with applicable laws), sort out disputes, and enforce our legal agreements and policies.

The Company will also keep Usage Data for internal analysis purposes. Usage Data usually sticks around for a shorter period, unless that data is used to beef up the security or improve the functionality of our Service, or if we're legally obligated to keep this data for longer.

### Transferring Your Personal Data
Your info (including Personal Data) gets processed at the Company's operating offices and wherever else the parties involved in the processing are located. This means this info might get shipped over to — and kept on — computers outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction, where data protection laws might differ from your own turf.

By agreeing to this Privacy Policy and submitting such info, you're essentially giving a nod to that transfer.

The Company will pull out all the stops, taking all reasonably necessary measures, to make sure your data is handled securely and in line with this Privacy Policy. We won't transfer your Personal Data to any organization or country unless there are solid controls in place (including the security of your data and other personal info).

### Wiping Your Personal Data
You've got the right to delete or ask for our help to delete the Personal Data we've collected about you. 🗑️

Our Service might even let you zap certain info about yourself right from within the Service.

You can always log into your account (if you have one) and hit up the account settings section that lets you manage your personal info to update, tweak, or delete your info. You can also get in touch with us to ask for access, correction, or deletion of any personal info you've given us.

But heads up: we might need to hold onto certain info when we have a legal obligation or a lawful basis to do so.

### Spilling the Beans on Your Personal Data

#### Business Transactions
If the Company gets involved in a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, your Personal Data might get transferred. We'll give you a heads-up before your Personal Data is moved and becomes subject to a different Privacy Policy.

#### Law Enforcement
In certain scenarios, the Company might be on the hook to disclose your Personal Data if required by law, or in response to valid requests from public authorities (like a court or a government agency).

#### Other Legal Requirements
The Company might spill your Personal Data if it genuinely believes such action is necessary to:
-   Comply with a legal obligation
-   Protect and defend the rights or property of the Company
-   Prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing connected with the Service
-   Protect the personal safety of Service users or the public
-   Guard against legal liability

### Keeping Your Personal Data Safe and Sound
The security of your Personal Data is a big deal to us, but keep in mind, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is ever 100% foolproof. While we bust our chops to use commercially acceptable ways to protect your Personal Data, we just can't guarantee its absolute security. 🔒

## Kids' Privacy
Our Service isn't aimed at anyone under 13. We don't knowingly collect personally identifiable info from anyone under 13. If you're a parent or guardian and you know your kid has given us Personal Data, please hit us up. If we find out we've collected Personal Data from anyone under 13 without verified parental consent, we'll take steps to delete that info from our servers. 🧒👧

If we need to rely on consent as the legal basis for processing your info and your country requires parental consent, we might ask for your parent's permission before we collect and use that info.

## Links to Other Websites
Our Service might have links to other websites we don't run. If you click on a third-party link, you'll be whisked away to that third party's site. We seriously recommend you check out the Privacy Policy of every site you visit. 🌐

We have zero control over the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party websites or services, and we don't take any responsibility for 'em.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
We might update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We'll clue you in on any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy right here on this page.

Before the changes kick in, we'll give you a heads-up via email and/or a prominent notice on our Service, and we'll update the "Last updated date" at the top of this Privacy Policy.

It's a good idea to check this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they're posted on this page.
