### Product & Feature Updates

1. **Niji 7 anime model is officially here!**
Niji 7, the anime model, is officially here! 🎉 Niji・Journey just dropped a massive update after a year and a half. This new version, detailed in this [Latest Version Introduction (AI News)](https://www.xiaohu.ai/c/xiaohu-ai/niji-journey-niji-7), brings a groundbreaking focus on visual **consistency**. Seriously, the eye specular highlights and reflection details are stunning ✨, and its prompt understanding is way sharper. Plus, there's a fresh **sref style transfer** feature, letting users easily swap character styles. The team revealed their aesthetic goal: "lines and space," aiming for a flatter, cleaner artistic vibe. <br/>![AI News: Niji 7 Anime Character Eye Specular Highlight Details Display](https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2026/01/news_01kem7xcgae5y8kdp4q38xat79.avif)<br/>

### Frontier Research

1. **FaceRefiner makes facial textures super real.**
FaceRefiner is here to make AI-generated facial textures look super real! 🤩 This [Paper (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04520) tackles that annoying old issue of inconsistent AI face details. Its clever approach treats 3D sampled textures as styles and uses **differentiable rendering** for transfer. What's awesome is it doesn't just pass high-level info; it nails pixel-level details too, so identity features stay intact. On datasets like Multi-PIE and CelebA, it blows existing methods out of the water.

2. **New research dives into human-computer collaboration for spotting phishing emails.**
A new study dives into human-computer collaboration for spotting phishing emails. 🕵️‍♀️ This [New Research (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04610) compared how well machine learning and humans judge phishing attempts. The models were pretty accurate, but their **confidence** was all over the place. Humans, on the other hand, used a richer set of language features, leading to more stable judgments. Interestingly, age played a role in detection effectiveness, but language proficiency didn't really move the needle.

3. **InfiAgent tackles dreaded context explosion in long tasks.**
InfiAgent is tackling the dreaded context explosion in long tasks. 🤯 This [Paper (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03204) introduces a file-centric state externalization scheme that keeps Agent inference context **length fixed**. That means no matter if a task runs for 10 steps or 1000, errors won't pile up. What's cool is a 20B open-source model, using this, performed nearly as well as much larger closed-source systems on an 80-paper literature review task. Pretty slick! 🚀<br/>![AI News: InfiAgent Framework Long Task Processing Architecture Diagram](https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2026/01/news_01kem7xhz8eq0a7kaa6babksfm.avif)<br/>
