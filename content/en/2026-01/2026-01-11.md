### Product & Feature Updates

1. **Niji 7 anime model officially live.**
Niji・Journey has just dropped a huge update, Niji 7, after a year and a half! ✨ This latest version, detailed in [Latest Version Introduction (AI News)](https://www.xiaohu.ai/c/xiaohu-ai/niji-journey-niji-7), focuses on a breakthrough in **visual coherence**. We're talking eye highlights and reflection details so clear they'll melt your heart 🤩, plus vastly improved prompt understanding. The new **sref style transfer** feature lets users 💥 freely migrate character styles. The team revealed their aesthetic direction is "lines and space," aiming for a flatter, cleaner artistic feel.<br/>![AI News: Niji 7 Anime Character Eye Highlight Details Display](https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2026/01/news_01kem7xcgae5y8kdp4q38xat79.avif)<br/>

### Cutting-Edge Research

1. **FaceRefiner makes facial textures more realistic.**
FaceRefiner is tackling the age-old problem of inconsistent AI-generated facial details! 💡 This [Paper (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04520) introduces a method that treats 3D sampled textures as styles and uses **differentiable rendering** for transfer. It doesn't just convey high-level info; it preserves pixel-level details 🤩 without losing identity features. On datasets like Multi-PIE and CelebA, its performance surpasses existing methods.

2. **Human-AI collaboration identifies phishing emails.**
A new study on human-AI collaboration for phishing detection is out! This [New Research (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04610) compared the abilities of 🤖 machine learning and human judgment in identifying phishing emails. Results show that while models have decent accuracy, their **confidence levels** fluctuate wildly. Humans, using richer linguistic features, show more stable judgments. Age impacts detection effectiveness, but language proficiency doesn't seem to play a big role.

3. **InfiAgent solves long-task context explosion.**
InfiAgent has a cool solution for long-task context explosion! This [Paper (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03204) proposes a file-centric state externalization scheme 🚀 that keeps the Agent's reasoning context **length fixed**. Whether a task runs for 10 steps or 1000, it won't accumulate errors. A 20B open-source model performed nearly as well as larger closed-source systems on an 80-paper literature review task.<br/>![AI News: InfiAgent Framework Long Task Processing Architecture Diagram](https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2026/01/news_01kem7xhz8eq0a7kaa6babksfm.avif)<br/>
